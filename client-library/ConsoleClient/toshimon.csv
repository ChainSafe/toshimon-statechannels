It has triangular eyes and trapezoid face, a rare face for a bug indeed, hence it made every other bug afraid of it. This Toshiomon was a typical internet bug until it found its way to a system where thousands of Eros data were stored. It used to roam around Japan's web system to look for potential prey. One evening, it came across a beacon of data overflowing from one system overpowering the rest. With all its might, in a matter of milliseconds, the system was hijacked. The owner of the system tried to get rid of the bug, but due to its petite structure it evaded every trap that was set. Once it escaped and left the system, it became the digital world's most notorious bug, Glitcheon. Find systems with the heaviest and complex data, and you will find this Toshimon.

Keets are normally very hygienic and tend to clean after themselves, keeping their fur groomed and the bows on their tails clean. It has a bright orange fur coat covering its body with two tiny fangs and bright pink eyes matching the color of its ribbon. Keets have existed decades ago as formal house-pets due to their docile and playful behavior. This Toshimon became a popular pet after a famous idol promoted their brand deals and photoshoots with their Keet alongside them in the photos and advertisements. The cute fluff ball soon became the face of many high-end brands, brandishing different accessories for the Toshimon to use for aesthetic purposes.

Firebug;31;2;1;1;Firebug is a tiny moth-like (and sized) Toshimon with a purple and red color scheme with its main body has a purple to red gradient from the bottom to the top. Its wings also sport a purple and red color with the outer wings being a dark purple and the inner parts a bright red. The two feelers on the top of its head help it signal for help when its in danger. The fur on its main body may seem harmless, however they are very hot to the touch and are soaked in a special toxin to protect itself from predators. Firebug was first discovered by a few kids playing in the forest that resided near the town they lived in. As they were walking through the small clearing, they found this small Toshimon resting on one of the bushes, collecting the pollen that it could collect from the flowers. Knowing kids, they were curious and they reached their hand out to touch the unfamiliar creature. To one of the kids' surprise, the skin that touched the Firebug's main body had burned and was slowly turning purple from the toxins that emit from Firebug's fur. Soon enough after this discovery was made, scientists decided to research this Toshimon's origin. Today, Firebugs can be seen frequenting dark, warm forests. This small Toshimon is still able to pack a very big punch despite its small body. When sensing danger, it uses the feelers on its head to signal closeby Firebug for help. It's able to breathe fire and roast targets that are slightly larger than it. It's main defense is its body, being able to protect itself from physical contact due to the dangerous nature of its fur.;146;8;2;90;92;87;75;85;76;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '7819cc72d47909648bf8bdf4272d7147', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '5d6fe4a9634012942a2f08f5c8dfd4da', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '4d40773acb9e6d84d96699e35cdd8a85', 'type': 2}}]
Flamoth;32;4;0;2;Like its predecessor Firebug, Flamoth also sports the same purple and red color scheme with a much larger body and bigger wings for better control of its movement in the air. The feelers on its head have also grown longer though it is unsaid if the longer length makes it easier for it to signal for help. It has also gained a dark purple zorro-ish mask on its face giving it a more sinister and intimidating appearance. The first discovery of this Toshimon happened when scientists were doing research in a forest clearing. They had visited the forest to conduct tests due to news of an abundance of Firebugs within the area. One scientist met their unfortunate demise when they had found this Toshimon in one of the dark caves near the clearing. The Flamoth then had burned the scientist completely and took off deeper into the forest. When the the late scientist's body had been submitted for autopsy, it was discovered that the flames that emitted from the Flamoth had caused a form of poisoning, making researchers believe that the fire that Flamoth breathes are infused with a very lethal poison that could inflict serious damage. Flamoth's prowess comes from its incredible fire breathing power and its improved lethal toxins. The poison dripping from its fur is now more lethal, which could cause immediate death. The flames breathes have the same dangerous poison infused within the gases of the flame which could kill anything. If someone were to come across an untamed Flamoth, do NOT provoke it or go within its range.;296;8;2;115;105;105;82;98;95;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'd2de26272d7fd514ab7e02e4111d307b', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'a49068708bba6a9468898d9d49ae1afa', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '5d6fe4a9634012942a2f08f5c8dfd4da', 'type': 2}}]

Cubo;35;1;0;0;Not much is there to describe Cubo. Its appearance is very plain, simple and straightforward, Cubo is merely a blue cube-like Toshimon with a simple smiley fixated on top. Its body is surprisingly malleable and can change its texture and shape depending on the situation Cubo puts itself in.Cubo's origin is a very mysterious story, one day a trainer was leaving Toshimon to store in their storage boxes on the PC when all of a sudden they see a bright blue cube sitting in the corner of the storage screen. Researchers are still unsure of how Cubo came to be. Theories suggest that Cubo manifested from the various Toshimon that were stored in the PC box which is why it has the ability to shape itself in any way for different situations. Cubo's main power comes from its ability to morph its body and its texture to both attack and defend itself. In most occasions though, you might see it running away most of the time since it doesn't excel in engaging head on fights.;56;1;0;70;65;78;80;90;62;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '103b3b819d681014480472f6e0b8de61', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '518599785f427d5488c0bed5c00bc6d8', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '330ccac694549e64d8f8461fad1eb745', 'type': 2}}]

Scrit's curled tail can also punch the enemies on their face and its front teeth, despite being not sharp enough, can still pierce through the skin.;60;1;0;140;70;65;85;50;60;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '103b3b819d681014480472f6e0b8de61', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'e1b1cea650414b34a88107c1a27d508f', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '330ccac694549e64d8f8461fad1eb745', 'type': 2}}]
Cubble;41;1;1;1;Cubble is a cute Toshimon with a teddy bear-like anatomy, having dark brown fur all over its body with bright purple eyes and a heart shaped navel with purple laces forming an â€˜X' in the middle. It has no claws and has tiny stumps on the ends of its limbs which adds to the innocent look. Don't let its cute appearance fool you though, this Toshimon still packs a huge punch despite its baby cub facade. Cubble began its life as a plain and simple teddy bear owned by a little girl living in the woods. This little girl would always have this stuffed animal around with her, even until her unfortunate death. She died in a very tragic house fire, and when she was found, the teddy bear was right beside her, except now it had gained darker fur and eerie glowing purple eyes. Some say that the girl's spirit has now possessed the teddy bear, thus giving birth to a new Toshimon, Cubble. Despite its origin, Cubble's power is not magical. Its main prowess comes from being able to attack with brute force and heavy swings.;61;1;0;70;60;70;60;65;85;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '103b3b819d681014480472f6e0b8de61', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '3f5faac8b11a06043880aa93380e0069', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '330ccac694549e64d8f8461fad1eb745', 'type': 2}}]
TerrorBear;42;2;0;2;TerrorBear is the evolved version of Cubble and has grown larger than its predecessor. This Toshimon now has a taller and wider body frame similar to a grizzly bear, now sporting huge claws on both its upper and lower limbs, eyes scarier with the same purple glow to them. The heart on its navel now resembles a broken heart unlike its previous form, Cubble.  TerrorBear evolves from the small and innocent looking Cubble. For Cubble to evolve, it would have to go through very rigorous training from its trainer. TerrorBear also thrives from the anguish and vengeance it feels ever since it was born into the world, thus giving TerrorBear the ability to show off its monstrous display of strength to all that oppose it. Just like Cubble, TerrorBear does not possess any magical power and excels best at physical damage and pure force. Its best asset are its extremely strong upper limbs that swing harder than a construction site wrecking ball. This Toshimon is very dangerous and requires proper training to keep it in check.;148;1;0;80;80;100;90;95;85;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '7e54cdc430948f44f99abb3d6b52fee0', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '5aba3bb0941d7344c8abcb419e294066', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '4d40773acb9e6d84d96699e35cdd8a85', 'type': 2}}]
Tomo;43;1;1;1;Tomo is a happy and friendly plant caretaker that lives to nourish other plant Toshimons.  It's pink-toned body glows and gives warmth that plants need when the sun is not in the mood to show up, while it's antennae sense danger or Toshimons in bad health. It might look like it but Tomo is not completely harmless. The leaves around its neck are not just a fashionable scarf, they also enable it to fly and tend to others more efficiently. Don't go near it though, they are sharp and can cut anything in its way. No one could miss its enticing eyes that can make you sleep and rest better. Usually, you can find only one of this complete care-package Toshimon in the area depending on how much caring it needs.;62;5;13;95;110;80;80;80;30;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '15a36c56339b40a43bcd6e8f228edde0', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '3c5d089033707d94f9ce1bdc60fd7b6a', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '330ccac694549e64d8f8461fad1eb745', 'type': 2}}]
Tomotoes;44;2;1;2;Unlike its lower form Tomo, Tomotoes can be found in Toshimon care facilities. This loving Toshimon tends to those that need intensive care. It has undergone training that help understand the anatomy and physiology of the monsters and how they can be healed from any illness or attack. When embraced by Tomotoes, even the deepest wounds heal. Its antennae can sense the health level of the patient while its leaf scarf excretes the needed medication. Tomotoes also train the Tomos before they are sent out to the world. Just like Tomo, they are not completely harmless. When in danger, looking in its eyes can make you do whatever it wants.;149;5;13;75;110;85;115;95;40;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '394b9fe3170d546468f4ba0761a1b182', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '1a210953059c5a648aff429da0eec30e', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '4d40773acb9e6d84d96699e35cdd8a85', 'type': 2}}]
Tomoqueen;45;4;0;3;There are only a few of majestic Tomoqueens in the land and they only appear in the most critical of times. Legend says that when there was total chaos, most Tomoqueens sacrificed to save as much Toshimons as they could. Aside from the basic and intensive care that Tomo and Tomotoes can give, Tomoqueen can try and bring back a Toshimon that had just lost its life. This is not easy as a Tomoqueen must give a part of itself a.k.a one of the leaves around its neck. The leaf is placed on the Toshimon's chest until absorbed and will be cared by Tomotoes until fully recovered. This is a good news only that as leaves are given out, Tomoqueen weakens.;297;5;13;95;110;115;125;110;50;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '66ffd8d801fc8e647979fdc1b1bc008d', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '323747166c006c2468df808462b3a17f', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '68f530ebb0d202448bde4b5124ef0edb', 'type': 2}}]
Daffofrill;46;1;1;1;Daffofrill does not have much going on for its appearance other than the fact that it looks like a normal flower. It has limbs that give it the ability to move and adapt to its different surroundings. The petals on its head are a bright pastel yellow and the limbs are a nice and healthy looking green. Daffofrill was found in the early days when Toshimon were beginning to emerge once again in civilization. It is said that a florist had accidentally mistaken Daffofrill for a common flower, which alarmed the Toshimon. The creature had then released a non-lethal powder that had left the florist drowsy. Soon enough the florist had fallen asleep, allowing Daffofrill to escape and find itself a different home. When the florist had awoken, she was unsure whether she had dreamed of a plain flower attacking her from no where. Daffofrill is a very passive fighter. Its main strength is the incredibly effective powder that it releases when it feels danger. In a pinch, it uses strobe to blind its predator to give it an opening to escape.;63;4;5;70;95;80;60;80;30;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '64fd7f6b353d405489d3741261e06f1f', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '4d8c2912b1c755c4c9183553cede8e21', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '330ccac694549e64d8f8461fad1eb745', 'type': 2}}]
Dandelight;47;2;0;2;From its very plain looking predecessor comes a livelier looking flower. Dandelight possesses four limbs and a head, all of which are physically detached from its body but kept in place due to the electromagnetic current within its system keeping the body parts intact. It has a bright white pair of eyes and a normal smile. The petals on its head have electricity flowing within them, best not to touch them in that case. Dandelight was first found in a power plant situated within a vast green meadow surrounded by flowers. The person that had seen Dandelight spotted the Toshimon feeding off of the electrical power the power plant had been producing. When the Dandelight had noticed the mysterious person's presence, it had emitted a bright light, blinding the human. When they had regained their vision, the mysterious flower-like creature had disappeared. Soon enough, Dandelight had become a staple in electricity production, aiding in maintaining proper electric current flow. Just like Daffofrill, Dandelight does not engage in head on fights, however it can prove to be a tricky opponent to face. The sleepy time powder it emits can leave targets asleep within seconds, paired up with its incredibly powerful electrocuting capabilities. As always, never underestimate a Toshimon based on its appearance.;150;4;5;85;105;95;85;90;60;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'd2bbc2fa501981447bfe7a7c4c46dd21', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '4d8c2912b1c755c4c9183553cede8e21', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '4d40773acb9e6d84d96699e35cdd8a85', 'type': 2}}]
Ringu;48;1;1;1;Ringu is a very odd looking Toshimon, it possesses two wings and it doesn't really have a solid body to rely on other than the ring of diamonds it keeps around its three yellow eyes. The diamonds around the eyeballs are what give Ringu its light power. Desert researchers were once uncovering old Toshimon ruins that date nearly hundreds of years ago. Within these ruins, researchers were uncovering ancient civilizations that existed before and how Toshimon were integrated into their daily lives. While exploring, they came across a flock of odd looking creatures. The next thing these people knew, a blinding light emerged that surrounded all of them. When they regained consciousness, they found themselves outside of the ruins. After much searching and deliberation of what the strange creature was, old textbooks say that they encountered the ancient pokemon Ringu. It is said that they protect the ruins from intruders or any unfamiliar entities that enter the ruins. Ringu's main source of power comes from the diamonds around the yellow belts that protect its eyes. Researchers are still unsure of how they channel power from these diamonds, however it is said that they have the ability to displace anyone.;64;4;0;60;55;50;80;65;100;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '057802e6f1a296642b5bc6c47f613053', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '48e7072ace8583a4f9565062ec772360', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '330ccac694549e64d8f8461fad1eb745', 'type': 2}}]
Ringu Wingu;49;2;0;2;Ringu Wingu is the evolved form of Ringu and unlike its pre-evolved state, Ringu Wingu is a bird-like Toshimon with dark raven feathers covering its body, halos surrounding its ankles. It retains its belts from its predecessor along with three eyes on either side of its head. Long ago, Ringu Wingu is said to have been one of the Toshimon that helped lead old civilizations.This ancient being allegedly has the ability to predict the future thanks to the diamonds around the belts above its head. Fortune Tellers would often keep this creature around and offer people a reading of their future. When thugs would think of committing crime, Ringu Wingu would not be too far behind, striking the criminals with a lethal poison emitting from its sharp talons. Ringu Wingu's light power has seemingly increased from when it was a mere Ringu, now with poisonous talons that emit a very dangerous poison that would render anyone struck by them weak. Unlike before however, Ringu Wingu is able to predict the future and warn people of when disasters are about to strike.;151;4;8;80;75;70;100;85;100;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'd2bbc2fa501981447bfe7a7c4c46dd21', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '3dfc66c7b339edd47a761a5cb1a7abb2', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '4d40773acb9e6d84d96699e35cdd8a85', 'type': 2}}]
Loch;50;1;1;1;Loch has four seal-like flippers and a hard shell back along with a short thick tail and a skull for a face with empty, hollow eye sockets. The short horns on its head are extremely sensitive however since they are used for echo-location and sensing its surroundings since it lacks eyesight. Loch used to be a fossil retrieved from ancient burial grounds from a ruin that researchers were once exploring. It was stated in the reports that multiple small fossils (similar to the one Loch was restored from) surrounded a larger scale fossil. Scientists are still in the process of restoring the large remains, leading them to believe that it could have been what gave birth to the multiple Loch fossils they found. Loch is able to manipulate the earth around it to create sinkholes and impair its opponents movement. Other than that, its very immobile on normal soil, however it excels at moving through sand, drifting at speeds faster than a cheetah running.;65;9;0;50;55;50;70;90;95;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'c3b9b56bdfa33ec4d916dbd42fdf3dc6', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'e028badd4e3f3bd4f8155ae2e0ccb104', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '330ccac694549e64d8f8461fad1eb745', 'type': 2}}]
Lochess;51;2;1;2;Lochess' body is relatively large, almost as big as a boat. Just like its predecessor Loch, this Toshimon has 4 flippers with sturdy rock hard protectors behind them to help make it easier for sand surfing. The rocky shell on its back has grown sturdier, gaining more stone plates. The horns on its head have grown larger, similar to a bull and the skull on its head has also grown larger. The short and thick tail has now become more slender and has a spikey ball at the end for a more flexible range of attack. Lochess is considered as one of the oldest Toshimon that has existed to date, going back to over hundreds of years ago. The only Lochess to have been reported to be seen today can be found in the Toshimon Central Research Laboratory after the Loch they have been taking care of evolved into the creature it is today. It is said that this majestic beast is what the huge fossil researchers uncovered found during the discovery of the Loch fossils. This Toshimon is said to be docile by nature but dangerous when provoked due to its large size and anatomy.Lochess' power comes from a mix of both being able to manipulate the earth around it and its incredible physical power. When provoked, it uses the spike ball on its tail to swing at its foe. As a last resort, it has the ability to break the soil under it and create a huge fissure to trap its opponent.;152;9;0;80;80;77;63;90;120;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'c3b9b56bdfa33ec4d916dbd42fdf3dc6', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'ba0e0c2cc9f704d45aafc9cd0b0fc02f', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '4d40773acb9e6d84d96699e35cdd8a85', 'type': 2}}]
Shoople;52;1;1;1;Shoople is a happy-go-lucky Toshimon that skips all day around the field. Its fluffy body and bubbly personality are a sight to see if you want to relax. This Toshimon can usually be found in green fields and is an indicator that there is no danger around. In the rare instance that danger is near, its cute horns blink until it is in safe distance. At night, Shooples stay together and take turns guarding the flock in warm places. Since their wool is flame-resistant, they like to tease fire Toshimons when they encounter them and would just skip their way out of the scene when the situation worsens.;66;1;0;80;90;70;80;80;90;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '103b3b819d681014480472f6e0b8de61', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'edf00f8ed4d32164c9297634047ee91e', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '330ccac694549e64d8f8461fad1eb745', 'type': 2}}]

However, Vedo did not reciprocate Deeva's feelings and only used it and dumped Deeva when Vedo's done toying with it. Deeva was devastated and sad that its heart turned cold then later its whole body became steel. Deeva vowed to never love another Toshimon again, and told despises every man ever in its entire life. Deeva lives up to its name because Deeva is a Diva, a center of attraction. With Deeva's warm embrace, every Toshimon will fall head over heels and will be cast under Deeva's spell. Every Toshimon that will be under its spell will become its slave that will follow all Deeva's demands without hesitation.

Thinlax;56;1;1;1;"Thinlax is an anthropomorphic Toshimon with a very skinny, lanky body and a huge head at the top of it. Despite its small body mass, Thinlax's torso sports rock hard six-pack abs and huge pecs that help intimidate its opponents. Its body fur is colored dark green for the outer parts and a dark yellowish color for the inner parts.There was a time that a young man had been walking around a jungle on a survival expedition for a variety show on a TV channel. While exploring, the young man had discovered a strange human-like figure in the distance, punching and kicking what seemed to be an old tree. The man then tried to call out to the figure, only to find himself running away after the mysterious creature came running at him. This was known to be the first time anyone has ever discovered Thinlax. Despite its lanky appearance, Thinlax is a Toshimon not to be scoffed at. It has an incredible amount of physical power that would make even the best martial artist look weak in comparison. It does have a very big setback, being that it has poor defenses due to the nature of its body, making it a very fragile Toshimon.

Bufflax;57;3;0;2;Bufflax is a massive anthropomorphic Toshimon, unlike its predecessor Thinlax. What used to be its lanky and skinny limbs have now become large and firm muscles. The color scheme from its previous form remains the same however. The abs on its stomach have grown harder and the pectorals of its chest have become larger as well. Bufflax was found soon after people had discovered that Thinlax existed. Researchers decided to look into Thinlax's natural habitat in the forest hoping to find more of the Toshimon there to conduct studies. They ended up finding a huge amount of Thinlax in a forest clearing, gathered around a large, bizarre looking shape. When the unknown object, or should we say creature began to stand up, these people were shocked to see a muscular looking Thinlax that had been bigger than every other Thinlax that there was in that clearing. It was concluded that upon harsh physical and muscular training, Thinlax are able to evolve into what we now know as Bufflax. Just by looking at Bufflax, you can already tell that this Toshimon's prowess comes from its immense physical strength. Not only that, but unlike Thinlax, Bufflax is now capable of taking a hit (or multiple) from its opponents. Its arms are its main asset, being able to smash and swing at targets at a very high speed with Haymaker which makes fighting this Toshimon very scary.;274;7;0;75;140;90;60;90;95;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '8bed956fa831df340b7ba8c815616535', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'bec78305a5dc83146925b1d19b87a8cc', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '034cef39039176441b8f7b2b8c2bc679', 'type': 2}}]

A mysterious forest is always on fire and once a traveler was brave enough to discover the mystery behind why, he found out that a wild raging tiger- cat is responsible for it. As time goes by, the tiger cat and the traveler grew in fond of each other as the traveler taught him how he can control its powers and use it for a good purpose. Flam is does not typically display emotions. While grooming, it collects fur inside its stomach. By setting the stored fur alight, it can spit fireballs that change based on how it coughs. Flam's fur produces flammable oils, and when it begins shedding, it burns all its fur in a blaze.

According to the scientific logs found in the Mansion of Cinnabar Island. Flamoof was born from a pregnant feline, found deep in the jungles of Guyana, whose embryo had been tampered with to alter its DNA. In short, Flamoof is created by science and its creator was nowhere to be found. Do not be deceived of its soft, adorable features because behind its physique is a tenacious flame. Its feline muscles are augmented with psychic power, giving it a grip strength of one ton and the ability to sprint 100 meters in two seconds.

It has bear-like ears and lavender eyes along with a tiny horn that it uses for communicating with its fellow kind. Weal's fleece is known to act as an insulator for harsh weather conditions to keep it comfortable.Weal's first sighting happened during a trip to the Antarctic region by a group of researchers. These people had hoped to further look into the emergence of Toshimon in the world and wanted to see if any new species would be seen there. Low and behold, one of these researchers ended up finding themselves coming across this cute little creature, swimming in small icy pools of the region, playing with its kind. Weal is known to be incredibly friendly and mischievous, always playing pranks and games with its friend and trainers. Weal's power packs a punch especially when faced in its natural habitat, icy biomes. Its ice capabilities are multiplied in said locations as well, considering it's easy for it to channel cool air into its body for defense. Weals are also incredibly skilled at swimming, being able to go to at high speeds.;69;6;0;100;90;90;50;50;90;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '893f32a870d982d438bb520ddb8e6d5b', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'd01a7e6752dd5044aa959b9d05e7c6de', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '5dd9258e25f8d404aae39dc0c8722ed0', 'type': 2}}]
Wealer;61;2;1;2;Wealer is a Toshimon with fins for arms and legs. It also has ice crystals protruding from its backs, despite these seemingly mobility reducing characteristics Wealer is surprisingly fast and agile especially in water and on slippery ice surfaces as it takes advantage of its fins to slip past any opponent. This Toshimon is covered in thick blubber that make it resistant to cold but also built with enough muscle to never tire from carrying many heavy crystals on its backs. Wealer is protective of its crystals that protrude on its back and fins, for Wealer's kind the crystals are a status, and the most pristine and finest ones are usually recognized as superior and held with respect. This nature of Wealer makes it a proud creature but this also puts this Toshimon at a disadvantage in battle because you can consider its crystals as its weak point. Wealer is a very strong attacker that can attack opponents with ice blasts from its mouth causing a Chill Breeze. This Toshimon have strong ice-manipulative abilities that allows it to create an Ice Shield as a way to defend itself.

Wealrus is a proud Toshimon, most especially because of its Ice crystals that it spends most of its time polishing and beautifying. Despite being beautiful objects of admiration, its crystals are not so easily destructible but are also a source of power for Wealrus.

Flyrus;65;3;0;3;Flyrus is a large, intimidating looking Toshimon with a relatively large body and wings with a dark indigo color. Its head is comprised of three computer-like screens and bat-like fangs for food consumption. Researchers discovered Flyrus during an expedition to an abandoned laboratory that had contained valuable information and data about Toshimon. During said expedition, these people had been looking around the area for any signs of power within the laboratory to extract the data from the old computers that were there. Unfortunately, they were met with a hostile threat that we now know as Flyrus. During this discovery, researchers attempted to call for back up through their devices, only to find them hacked and unusable with Flyrus around. These researchers were able to escape, without the data sadly. Flyrus' is an incredibly skilled Toshimon both in combat and in digital disruption. It can use its digital capabilities to pass through networks and computers, eating away any valuable data and rendering these devices useless. To protect itself from harm, it uses a firewall to allow it to bypass and escape from any security threats within the system. In physical combat, Flyrus is no joke either. The wings on its back allow it to maneuver the air well and move quickly, while its fangs are useful for attacking and biting any opponent.;276;11;12;75;55;75;135;110;120;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '187d84749ba863d4e8576bd17f7d1a88', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'e337f8050edbaa74f9e641160bc1a323', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '102251a9109c81d44b1dc5634fb56fb4', 'type': 2}}]

Having a Cirviar on your team is a sure way to cheer you up, as they love to perform for you!;86;3;0;60;105;90;40;75;95;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'e7f09877ebd7bb141bae50d70413556c', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '58262f336e9b2644e8dcc8993374dc1f', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '9b16425f14cdc8b49b74ebf71a339d8a', 'type': 2}}]
Poissot;99;2;0;2;"Poissot is quite the trickster! These Toshimon reside within the coral hideouts of the Clown Reefs and love to play pranks on the other Toshimon who live there. Whether it be pulling an endless string of brightly colored scarves from behind their ear or spritzing them with a sea anemone, Poissot always gets a good laugh. However, Poissot's special attacks are certainly no laughing matter. A fun fact about Poissot is that if you look closely, their ""noseâ€ is actually a Cirviar! This is another one of Poissot's pranks, feel free to give it a good honk - but be warned that you might get a splash to the face!";163;3;0;85;130;120;50;85;75;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '12c0a430c4e6eaf47b7d382c91251835', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '8c6f9487b67246c44a1a8b4b71d7fdea', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '58262f336e9b2644e8dcc8993374dc1f', 'type': 2}}]
Ray;100;1;1;1;Ray is a free-spirited Toshimon who loves to ride the ocean currents all day long. Ray is a true explorer of the deep and loves to go wherever the tide takes him. For this reason, it can be hard to track a Ray down as they don't have a singular place of residence, but if you journey out into the ocean far enough you may see them leaping out of the water from time to time. While Ray is a typically laid-back Toshimon, you don't want to get in the way of his Spritz attack which can send enemies flying. Secretly, Ray is also a great dancer, put on your favorite music and watch him flip and twirl to it.;87;3;0;55;55;65;75;75;100;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'e7f09877ebd7bb141bae50d70413556c', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '58262f336e9b2644e8dcc8993374dc1f', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '9b16425f14cdc8b49b74ebf71a339d8a', 'type': 2}}]
Doomray;101;3;0;2;Think of Doomray as the moody, emo brother of Ray. Doomray resides deep in the ocean where there is barely any light. This Toshimon has developed especially keen senses to make up for this difficult environment including night vision and an incredible sense of smell and taste. Doomray uses reflective scales along his spine to lure in his prey, look for these reflective scales when searching for a Doomray yourself to be able to spot one. Doomray is capable of blasting enemies away with his Firehose maneuver. No enemy will want to find themselves on the receiving end of Doomray's spiked tail when he exacts his Revenge attack either!;284;3;12;60;75;75;100;100;140;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '6d7543b0073e15c4497fd15d4a01d078', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '102251a9109c81d44b1dc5634fb56fb4', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '58262f336e9b2644e8dcc8993374dc1f', 'type': 2}}]
Pistach;102;1;1;1;Pistach is a colorful Toshimon who can be found deep within the dry and hot electric deserts attached to motherboard trees. The Pistach use the electrical currents from these robotic plants to charge up and communicate with the other Pistach located all over the world. Pistach is a very smart Toshimon who can hack into any device, anywhere, any time. But don't forget that these guys are plant-type as well! Pistach can also attack with their special Leaf Blower tactic, a combination of strong wind and razor-sharp leaf edges will leave any opponent crumbling. A fun fact about the Pistach is that while they connect their wires to the motherboard trees, they can close themselves up and hang there like they are ready to be picked!;88;5;11;70;95;35;85;30;100;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '8106c6ae042c15446b79c2724645af3d', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'b117d8e10c7f1af49b07f4149d562d54', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '60dd6fb21209ef746954e8bee445e67e', 'type': 2}}]
Pistachodon;103;3;0;0;Pistachodon is a rambunctious Toshimon who loves to run free throughout the electric deserts. Pistachodon has developed a way to be less tied to the motherboard trees than Pistach, and has the ability to go wireless for a much longer time. In fact, unlike Pistach, these Toshimon are much harder to find as they prefer to stray into the database oasis and play VR games with their friends. The travel through the harsh desert climate is worth it however - these Toshimon don't play games when it comes to battles! Pistachodon can stop enemies in their tracks by using their DDOS attack, or connect with others through their networking harddrive to launch a special Symbiote maneuver against an enemy. Another fun fact about Pistachodon is that in your off time you can hook him up to your devices and use him as a speaker wherever you go.;285;5;11;100;135;40;135;40;130;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'cd488bb87364c50468a6b80e173a89c2', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '66ffd8d801fc8e647979fdc1b1bc008d', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '1a210953059c5a648aff429da0eec30e', 'type': 2}}]
Mudwhale;104;1;1;1;Mudwhale comes from the muddy depths of the swampy seas. This Toshimon may come from murky waters, but is an optimistic and fun-loving character. Mudwhale uses his strong flippers to create giant sinkholes that can easily trap his enemies. He also tends to use this technique on his buddies as a way to play pranks on them. These Toshimon can be hard to spot at first because of their unique camouflage, but you can typically find them playing together in groups. Prove yourself to be as much of a fun prankster as he is and you will easily befriend any Mudwhale you find.;89;9;0;50;50;95;80;85;50;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'c3b9b56bdfa33ec4d916dbd42fdf3dc6', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '26458c5671b1d4441b53a0336964fd58', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '74ef0b2d1708cc144b849edc7267d1fd', 'type': 2}}]
Mudorca;105;2;0;2;Mudorca is of a slightly larger variety than the Mudwhale, and can be found in the colder northern swampy seas. Due to the chilly climate, Mudorca has also developed more of his fluffy coat than Mudwhale has. Don't let his fluff deceive you however, while Mudorca is a playful fellow, he does have more of a dangerous side to him as well. Watch out for his tunneling attack, as he's developed it to be able to take his opponents by surprise and become a keen hunter of the deep. The easiest time to spot a Mudorca is when he surfaces for air- you can spot one by their iconic double blowholes.;164;9;0;60;80;110;100;100;65;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '3eab7df3108470d4e9cc7c792a663c86', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '9f413179d338b6a429ad0576521c153d', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'ca13b3b0c6d1b8d4b90c32cae576b785', 'type': 2}}]
Johnny;106;1;0;0;Johnny is a cool, calculated Toshimon, certainly he is not one to mess around with. You can find Johnny by looking around active volcanoes for entrances to underground dwellings that he has carefully constructed. These Toshimon are expert blacksmiths, they use the hot magma to forge their armor (which adds an extra punch to his leg sweep attack against opponents.) If one of these Toshimon likes you, he may even surprise you with something extra special one day. Johnny is a quick thinker and can easily use his gambler technique to analyze his opponent, and make sure he comes out on top.;90;7;0;50;120;75;55;110;87;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '84b06bfba06e4a94995ff8c03215393d', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '034cef39039176441b8f7b2b8c2bc679', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '93f9b9cfb7e626e4c9b6539414292f21', 'type': 2}}]
Kibby;107;2;0;0;Don't be fooled by this Toshimon's sweet face and those squishable paws, Kibby is not a Toshimon you want to mess with! Kibby uses their wings to dart around their opponent in order to deliver a series of powerful punches that their enemy won't even have a chance to see coming. In the wild, you can find these Toshimon sprinting through vast green meadows. They use their big fluffy wings to launch into the air and fly wherever their heart desires. Because of their playful nature, Kibby can be hard to catch, but show these Toshimon you can be down for a good tussle and they will gladly oblige.;165;7;0;75;120;75;75;120;76;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '8bed956fa831df340b7ba8c815616535', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'e659f186565b68b49932efe8e453123f', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'bec78305a5dc83146925b1d19b87a8cc', 'type': 2}}]

Constor;109;1;1;1;Constor comes from the toxic pink marshes where they can be found soaking up the sun atop a cozy rock. These Toshimon have learned from their surroundings and developed a method of releasing poison gases through the holes in their backs to keep themselves safe from enemies, you do not want to get too close when they attack with their smog! These Toshimon are loyal friends and love to gas each other up, they make great cheerleaders for your other Toshimon in battle. Constor can also use their hollow shells much like an instrument to play you your favorite songs in your off time!;92;8;0;45;80;95;70;65;45;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '5f448fee37b513449ba64b9012e82bcc', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '7819cc72d47909648bf8bdf4272d7147', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '74ef0b2d1708cc144b849edc7267d1fd', 'type': 2}}]
Constosaur;110;2;0;2;Much like Constor, Constosaur comes from the toxic pink marshes and lakes covered perpetually with a layer of poisonous gases. Constosaur is often mistaken for a massive boulder, but can be identified by the triangle-shaped holes in his back that make a kind of whistling noise when the wind goes through them. Constosaur is tough and not to be messed with- a cool, strong Toshimon who makes a great addition to any team. While their size is especially formidable, their true power comes in their attacks using toxic smog to subdue their enemies in mere seconds. Get too close and Constosaur won't hesitate to give enemies a venomous bite either! Constosaur is a real powerhouse that is a great addition to any battle.;166;8;0;65;90;120;85;80;60;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'd2de26272d7fd514ab7e02e4111d307b', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '3dfc66c7b339edd47a761a5cb1a7abb2', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '4d40773acb9e6d84d96699e35cdd8a85', 'type': 2}}]
Rockworm;111;1;1;1;Rockworm is one Toshimon you will want in your collection just to show off. These Toshimon cultivate glittering crystals on their backs to blend in with their environment. While less difficult to find than Gemsnake, it can still take some hard searching to make out where they are among the various stones that line the entrances to the crystal caverns where they live. The trick is to get them to move, but not frighten them as their special attack is to use their powerful bodies to trigger a sinkhole right underneath their enemy! It sure is not easy to climb out of one of those. Try tempting them into coming near you with some special crystals of your own- the higher the vibrational frequency the better!;93;9;0;90;85;95;55;50;25;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'c3b9b56bdfa33ec4d916dbd42fdf3dc6', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '26458c5671b1d4441b53a0336964fd58', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '74ef0b2d1708cc144b849edc7267d1fd', 'type': 2}}]
Gemsnake;112;2;0;2;Gemsnake is one flashy little guy! These Toshimon can be found deep underground in crystal caverns where they have evolved to blend in by growing gemstones right on their back. These caverns are some of the most beautiful, but also most dangerous places- made evident by Gemsnake's special tunnel attack which can cause enemies to fall straight down into the earth! If you are careful though, you can avoid one of them sneaking up on you and instead follow their tunnels down to their dens where they collect rare gems from the cavern's depths. It is also said that depending on which kind of gems your Gemsnake collects, having them with you can give you various healing benefits.;167;9;0;105;130;120;55;85;40;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '3eab7df3108470d4e9cc7c792a663c86', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '9f413179d338b6a429ad0576521c153d', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'ca13b3b0c6d1b8d4b90c32cae576b785', 'type': 2}}]
BigToe;113;1;0;0;BigToe comes from the rocky cliffs where active volcanoes spew magma constantly down to the shore. This Toshimon is a hardworking Toshimon who trains their whole life. Living on the mountains gives them plenty of terrain to practice on. BigToe may not have particularly high stats, but can really withstand the punches! This Toshimon has clearly become one with their environment and become hard as a rock to knock down. BigToe is especially effective in their Coach technique to help your other Toshimon in the arena, or to intimidate enemies with their Swagger.

Poople;114;1;0;0;A Poople has got to be one of the oddest little creatures the Toshimon world has to offer. This amphibious little guy can be seen disguising himself as a plant by floating in the water, or hiding himself as a clump of mud on land. The Poople uses his tiny arms and legs to scurry around quickly while on land in order to not be caught- so watch out! His small size and fast legs make him easy to lose track of. Just because the Poople is tiny at first doesn't excuse him from being a formidable opponent - the Poople can actually grow many times his own size! As a fun fact, when Pooples grow, the seeds they carry on their back can actually sprout a variety of flowers. You could create a whole garden of Pooples!;95;5;0;65;55;115;100;40;60;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '15a36c56339b40a43bcd6e8f228edde0', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '4d8c2912b1c755c4c9183553cede8e21', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'ca13b3b0c6d1b8d4b90c32cae576b785', 'type': 2}}]
Brawlosaur;115;2;0;0;Brawlosaur comes from far up north in the grassy tundras where each night you can see the aurora borealis high up in the sky. Brawlosaurs grow a rare type of gem on their backs which take in those colors of the night sky and glow a beautiful green color. There is a lot of speculation, but some people believe that these crystals actually came down from outer space originally. Look for these Toshimon at night in order to be able to identify them easier by their green glow. Like their name says, these hot headed Toshimon were made to rumble!

Glorp;116;1;1;1;Glorp is the cutest creature of the deep, with a round belly and chubby cheeks. He is small but fiesty with his glowing red eyes and angler fish dangle danglin' from his head.

Spritz is what will really get you splashin' when using Glorp. He prefers cold salt water and only comes to the surface to spit game to the other fishies and crabs.

He is always looking for an excuse to flex his flippers and slap silly anyone who gets in his way. Mist is his power and he will use it to soak his opponents to the bone and momentarily obscure their vision. Glorpon spends his rest days lurking on the bottom of the ocean waiting for lovely ladies to slide into his DMs. You can attract Glorpon by casually blasting Wutang Clan from your boat or on the shore.

You can find him chomping around the beach on a sunny day, soaking up some rays. Skitter hates bad weather so on a cloudy day you can find him hanging out in a tide pool with his sea urchin homies. This also means that the only time he will use his spritzing powers are while he's chilling in the pools. Gym/ tan/ laundry is his daily routine, which is how he keeps his claws so big and shiny so he can try to fist pump his way into the hot parties on the weekend. His favorite snacks are sour patch kids and Hot Cheetos.;97;3;0;50;80;70;70;70;90;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'e7f09877ebd7bb141bae50d70413556c', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '58262f336e9b2644e8dcc8993374dc1f', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '9b16425f14cdc8b49b74ebf71a339d8a', 'type': 2}}]
Skidaddle;119;2;0;2;Skadaddle is everything Skitter wants to be. He skips the laundry and doubles up on the gym. He is raw vegan and won't hear any smack about it. You can find Skadaddle bathing on the beach, reading Plato or Lao Tsu, shoo-ing away all the heart-eyed beach babes swooning for him. Skadaddle has his own huge eyes so he can power read, see who is skipping leg day, and spot his favorite vegan food truck from a mile away. If you want to lure in Skadaddle and avoid getting pinched or worseâ€¦ brushed off..., be sure to stop by your local farmer's market and pick up some veggies to whip up into a grain-free Buddha Bowl. This man can eat. He needs over 20,000 calories a day to keep up with his intense workout routine. Your boy is making gains. He also has a soft side and loves watching the sunset with his homies and his long time girlfriend. He makes his own kombucha and loves talking about it, so it is also a good idea to ask him about his Scooby if you want any chance of getting on his good side.

You can find him riding dirty in the southwest where it's hot and dry. He avoids cactus' because they scare him a little ngl, but he is curious about what that forbidden fruit tastes like and is currently concocting a plan to find out. A great way to catch Peet is figuring out how to get the cactus fruit before him and then teasing him with it because: 1) he could be running through schemes for years before actually mustering up the courage to try and get it himself and 2) he loves playing mind games and tbh? isn't interested in wasting his precious time talking to anyone who won't play with him.;98;12;0;50;70;70;70;70;85;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '5b6ee1ae8bf5da144b378eb48fa69342', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'edf00f8ed4d32164c9297634047ee91e', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'e1b1cea650414b34a88107c1a27d508f', 'type': 2}}]
Peebet;121;2;1;2;Peebet is a little bigger, a little lazier, and a little more comfortable with himself than Peet. He likes to hang out on the side of Route 66, hitchhiking and meeting strangers. When he's not there he's sleeping in nearby caves catching some shade. His sucker punch will completely spin your head around and he thinks it's hilarious to watch. Knocking others out is Peebet's favorite past-time. He has the face of someone who smelt it and he most definitely dealt it. Could probably pull off a leather jacket but it wouldn't be real leather because even though he's a kind of a prankster and can be a bit of a jerk sometimes, deep down he's woke af and would never wear animal skin. He likes to get his feathers fluffed and brushed, so if you want to catch him bring a comb and hair dryer and he'll come running.;171;12;11;60;75;85;100;85;90;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '769797c7739bf3048b10ef0d969da560', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '55562252d5a8ad64b92c467a930b12d1', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '5fcf515b47ddb824a88890253391be32', 'type': 2}}]
Peebotron;122;3;0;3;Peebotron is a total boss and prefers they/them pronouns.Their huge wings span 6 feet, carrying them high into the sky above all the haters. They love hanging with their friends and going out to late-night karaoke. They are unbelievably beautiful when seen in real life. Their long necks allow them to tower over everyone else. They've been trying to find the perfect neck piece to decorate their most endearing feature, but have a hard time finding quality drip out in the desert where they live. They are always rolling their eyes at their lil homies, Peet and Peebet, but will in the end Peebotron is there to get them out of trouble and smack around anyone who messes with them. Honestly? Good luck catching a Peebotronâ€¦. but if you want to give it try, bring a little lipgloss and a lot of tequila to pique their interest. Gold is Peebotron's favorite color AND metal so use that information as you will....;286;12;11;60;80;90;130;100;120;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '2957fe44d5cf8a04493efe84e54a4693', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '5b6ee1ae8bf5da144b378eb48fa69342', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '55562252d5a8ad64b92c467a930b12d1', 'type': 2}}]
Stitches;123;2;0;0;Stiches is a freak in the streets, in the fleets, and in the metaphysical plane. He's over 6 feet tall and super mysterious, so he is obviously popular with the ladies as well as with the fellas. Stitches doesn't see anything other than vibes and if the vibe is right? He will twinkle-toe his way right into your heart. He loves looking at himself in his mirror just as much as he loves making you look at your deepest, truest, most hidden self in his mirror. He is in constant conversation with the voices inside his head, and loves to gossip with them. Envy is his greatest power and his greatest weakness, so be intentional with your flexing around this dude. You can find him in cold dark places like caves and under bridges. You can hear him coming from the clanking of his armor in the distance. His favorite color is brown and only eats brown foods.;172;12;0;70;110;80;70;80;105;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '773c896fba1ca6b4b82bb76fc347619c', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '3f272e3ddbcf9604e8bd41657f826bdc', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '26458c5671b1d4441b53a0336964fd58', 'type': 2}}]
Rootie;124;1;1;1;Rootie may look adorable, but her cute exterior contains a fierce spirit. She's a small and fluffy winter fox. Rootie has the softest fur on the planet and is pretty proud of it. She loves chin scratches and getting her tail combed. She knows she is a princess and will only wear a collar made of the finest silk, and only sleeps on a bed made of freshly fallen snow. Her go to power is Hack, which she uses to tap into your brain with her cute innocent appearance. Once she's made it past your mental defenses she takes you over so that she can keep you as a pet or butler (depending on how cute she finds you). Whenever people realize her trickery, she throws up a Firewall to protect her beautiful things and herself from any counterattack. It is almost impossible to breach Rootie's set-up unless she invites you there or gives you the special and ever changing access code. She snacks on popsicles and candy canes because they are sweet and pretty just like her. A great way to lure in Rootie-- before she can lure in you-- is by making a trail of candy to your desired location and keeping a blindfold on while you capture her.;124;11;0;65;50;35;115;95;95;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'b117d8e10c7f1af49b07f4149d562d54', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'e337f8050edbaa74f9e641160bc1a323', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '66894d54bacbf8742b9320e8b3d8a554', 'type': 2}}]
Cutie;125;1;1;2;Cutie is a little larger than Rootie and has a lot more attitude. Cutie doesn't like her amazingly soft fur touched at all and prefers to be alone. Her hat and collar are made of rare snowflake silk and diamonds found in arctic caves. She hates people with bad posture and loves reality television. You can find her lounging in her caves with diamonds around her bed and endless amounts of Tito's vodka flowing gently from a fountain she had installed custom made by the world renown Frost Fairy Sculptors. She constantly emits a slight breeze that is refreshingly chill to skin, and that some say will prevent aging. However, when she feels threatened or annoyed, she can amplify this breeze into a frigid gust that will completely freeze everything it touches and has even blown people away before. If you want to catch Cutie you'll have to put in some effort/charm, play it cool, keep the drinks flowing, and hope for the best.;100;11;6;65;83;57;95;85;105;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'b117d8e10c7f1af49b07f4149d562d54', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '893f32a870d982d438bb520ddb8e6d5b', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '66894d54bacbf8742b9320e8b3d8a554', 'type': 2}}]
Patootie;126;3;0;3;Patootie is the largest winter fox, and Rootie and Cutie's older brother. He is long and slick. His fur is not fluffy or soft and he doesn't want it to be. He is usually in a bad mood because he hasn't gone on a date in years. He is the only one of his kind and travels through the snow alone, grumpily searching for love. Packet loss is his power and he usually feels that it is an inconvenience at best. A gray cloud of freezing rain follows Patootie everywhere, which grows in size and intensity the more agitated he gets. Needless to say, intimacy has always been a little tricky for him. He is rarely hungry because he is always munching on his feelings, but when he does eat an actual meal it's usually quick savory foods like sardines and tuna salad. Good luck catching this guy because he's always on the move and not easily tricked.;287;11;6;90;125;66;125;85;93;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '187d84749ba863d4e8576bd17f7d1a88', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'd391d61d9b7c39c439dd1634cfc73df5', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '66894d54bacbf8742b9320e8b3d8a554', 'type': 2}}]
Sheetman;127;2;0;0;Sheetman is a total quantum space cadet. He blends in easily with walls and doors and loves to experiment with structure and space. He's always rambling about different lives he's lived and dimensions he's broken through. All of his friends ask him for help solving problems that are a bit too math-y or far out to bring up with anyone else. He knows what's up and would never judge a homie for anything. His power of DDOS makes his enemies go into a trance after touching his limbs, which are all direct portals into the depths of various quantum universes he has been discovering as a passion project. If you are trying to catch Sheetman, be sure to wear gloves to avoid touching his limbs with your bare hands (unless you want to end up wandering space and time until he remembers to pull you back out into this dimension again!). He lives only indoors and can not handle being exposed to any outdoor elements. Splashing him with water will disable his powers, but also will short circuit his brain and make him incapable of any motor function until he completely dries out, which could take anywhere from a few hours to a few millenia depending on which dimensions get damp.;173;11;0;65;125;100;55;70;85;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'cd488bb87364c50468a6b80e173a89c2', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'cda8fea038d0e9441b7dc774a6061230', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'edf00f8ed4d32164c9297634047ee91e', 'type': 2}}]
Leorak;128;1;0;0;For as long as anyone can remember Leorak has been on a joyous quest for the best tree to rest his head on. He's a lanky fox boy who casually drips with swag. He travels the most wild, mystical edges of the forest in a full fit of green armor made by the various fairies living in all the trees that he has ever napped on. Forest Fairies are legendary craftsmen but will only bestow their gift on True-Hearts. Leorak naturally befriends these tree folk and so every link in his chainmail has been delicately crafted for him, usually as he sleeps beneath the tree where these Faries dwell. The chainlinks are imbued with simple yet strong magic, each one slightly different from the others, but all weaving together in perfect harmony, just like the trees of the forest Leorak traverses. His tail is super fluffy and the fairies love to slide down it while he sleeps. He is pretty sure their musical giggling gives him beautiful dreams, and he has never had a nightmare as far as he can remember. Leorak prefers warm weather because there's no need for blankets and he can stretch his long limbs out as he rests. He loves a good back scratch or belly rub between his armor, playing tug of war with his friends, and the occasional kiss on the nose. Having reboot as his power is fitting, because his calm demeanor and love of napping are big sources of energy and healing. He can extend his Reboot to plants, animals, other Toshi, and anyone down to hang out with him for a while and catch him up on what's been going on in the world outside of the forest. His large pointy ears can hear even the slightest noise so don't try to sneak up on Leorak. He may be sleepy but his mind is sharp and fast, and he doesn't take kindly to tricks or traps. He is not a hard fox catch and loves sitting in comfortable silence with people while enjoying a smooth jazz tune or the latest Alex G album.;101;11;0;75;100;95;40;70;110;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'f6d51b9b854d06145ae042fa8a785ce4', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'fbe639f1798bbe74c8299f6be6841285', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '5fcf515b47ddb824a88890253391be32', 'type': 2}}]
Nyan;129;4;0;0;Nyan is down right precious. She flies through the sky with her chubby pop tart body, always followed by a vibrant rainbow. Her positive energy can be felt even from far away. She is always purring and licking her frosting belly. Her favorite colors are pink and sparkly. Her rosy cheeks are always warm and her tiny nose is always damp. When she's not flying amongst the stars you can find Nyan shedding fur all over her friends' houses and sleeping in well decorated cardboard boxes. You can catch Nyan with a ball of yarn or a mirror with some sunlight reflecting off of it. Her special Hash power gives off a calming and silly feeling, similar to Leorak's Reboot, but more of a mental recharge than a full body healing. She is bubbly and bursting with energy to play games with buddies. She will happily share her energy with anyone who asks nicely, using her special Energy Beam. Nyan is a total babe and treat to be around.;302;11;0;100;100;100;120;120;80;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'a6613fb5d61b1a948aa8a33d6ed1c45e', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'ee4f8103710cce74aac9a60147eeed7d', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '187d84749ba863d4e8576bd17f7d1a88', 'type': 2}}]
Prissey;130;3;1;1;Prissey is just the way her name sounds, a pampered Queen who won't accept anything less than she deserves. Her power of Heartbreak is not one to be taken lightly. One look at this pretty girl and you're hypnotized. She loves the attention of her many suitors, but is easily exhausted by too much affectionâ€¦ like ð„‡â¥€.â¥€ð„† get real!! She wears the same style dress and bow every day but has a closet full of other options she refuses to throw away or even put into storage for next season. A girl needs options okay! Her credit card limit is nonexistent and her mimosas are bottomless. Her cheeks are fluffy and soft and she loves grooming them in her heart shaped mirror, which is where you can  usually find her, admiring herself and wondering if any other heart will ever look as good. It's hard for Prissey to pick up things if she drops them because she has no fingers and a line of people just waiting to do these things for her. A smart way to catch Prissey is leaving a package on her front stoop with an empty locket, a shard of broken mirror, and an anonymous love letter with romantic clues for her to daydream about.;288;13;0;120;120;79;60;100;81;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '323747166c006c2468df808462b3a17f', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '68f530ebb0d202448bde4b5124ef0edb', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '6ce4704362586a64996c41cbd94b529b', 'type': 2}}]
Prissem;131;3;0;2;Prissem is a bigger and badder Prissey. She is a grown woman of the world who is no longer interested in the silly love games she once played in her youth. Her closet is ten times the size of the biggest closest you can think of and she has a jewelry collection that is beyond compare. This collection is whispered about amongst the other Toshimon, who have heard rumours of its beauty and volume. Her power (shooting icy shards from the tip of her lustrous tail) is lightning quick, powerful, and extremely dangerous. People have been known to lose their eyes from the icy daggers that she whips towards them, usually without even looking up from her phone. If you want to catch her, you will have to woo her not just with fancy things (she has plenty of those) but also by surprising her and making her laugh. For her, someone doing what she expects of them is, while useful, totally boring. She craves surprises because after living such a full and long life, a good surprise is almost impossible for her to find. Prissem is very picky about the placement of her purple bow-- it can't be too high or too low on her tail or she will have a total meltdown (which is never to be discussed again once she has pulled herself together). She also loves to wear her collar up high on her neck to help feel more sophisticated and to hide her most prized piece of jewelry-- a simple gold locket that no one has ever seen inside of except for her. Diamonds float around Prissem because they're attracted to her aura, which is very warm and loving once she puts her many hardened ice walls down.;289;13;6;135;130;85;70;110;60;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'e1e9e091b411f0d4db83c225bed95e6f', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'a6203336eecb05f48b41e2da016f314c', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '394b9fe3170d546468f4ba0761a1b182', 'type': 2}}]
Duose;132;1;1;1;Duose although these two cuties may look like separate individuals, in fact, they share one brain which is cycles between seeking snacks, new Tiktok trends, and cuddles. Duose is one sweet Zoomer baby in two adorable bodies-- which incidentally are totally blind. Because they were born without vision, their big brain has developed a super-sense that picks up on lovebug vibes and gravitates them in the right direction. They have been known to seek stability by using Love Potion to make sure that any cuddles that they find can be theirs forever!! While the best way to get close to Duose is to offer them love, make sure to be careful with your affection, if you aren't you could end up being Duose's cuddle buddy for eternity!

Seaduo;133;2;0;2;Seaduo while Seaduo may look like a grownup version of Dousa, they are in fact very different! These sleek twins have two distinct minds and personalities. There is Sea: the pink pretty boy who loves vaping, taking pics with friends, and collecting nail polish. And then there is Duo: the sleek blue lady who loves to longboard, play her ukelele, and study astrology. The twins co-run a very popular Discord page, which they use to pick up internet cuties and learn about new zines and bandcamp releases. You can catch these baddies at any Book or Art Fair, or more commonly in their underwater studio apartment where they take turns between sleeping on the pull out sofa and the twin mattress they found in the alleyway behind their building last year. They love hosting friends and will almost always try to get YOU to come to THEM for a nice chill sesh using their charming Warm Embrace. They want you to know how hip they are, so watch out if you find yourself feeling a lame or a little too enamored by their chic lifestyle: they might have used Mist to cloud your eyes and obscure the less-than-perfect parts of their very grammable life. These guys are a total blast and mainly just looking for some good company, conversation, and affirmation if you have the time!;174;13;3;115;55;50;115;115;70;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '394b9fe3170d546468f4ba0761a1b182', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'a354ef17b9cdfb14fbf0d74fa2e02258', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '12c0a430c4e6eaf47b7d382c91251835', 'type': 2}}]
Sweef;134;2;0;0;"Sweef just rolled out of bed and into some old clothes (he didn't even notice he put on the Dior!) and still looks effortlessly better than everyone at the function. Everyone wants to be seen with him and-- just know-- his heavy lidded eyes clocked you, your fit, your crew, your cut, and your vibes the moment you walked through the door. He will happily find a well lit spot to plant himself at any event and let the people come to him. If he approves of you and your choices, he will make easy conversation with you for hours before suddenly realizing he is late to another, MORE exclusive event, and has to leave. If he does not approve of you and you still approach him, he will quickly use Dish Out to read your entire life and make you question why you thought it was even okay for you to leave the house, let alone TALK to anyoneâ€¦ While Sweef may be aloof and harsh to strangers, he also uses his power to defend his close circle of well vetted, trusted, and respected friends; as well as to defend members of marginalized communities which he cares about deeply. The best way to earn this socialite's respect is to look good and completely ignore him. He isn't used to being overlooked and it will pique his interest if you casually pretend you can't see him over there in the center of the room, absolutely dying for you to notice him.";175;13;7;130;65;60;110;95;65;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '3c5d089033707d94f9ce1bdc60fd7b6a', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '034cef39039176441b8f7b2b8c2bc679', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'b7d64259ed68cff4cb810765a32dcc20', 'type': 2}}]
Pom-Pom;135;2;0;0;Pom-Pom is one Happening girl. She is always dressed to the nines in her signature pink fluffy look, tied together with a teeny bow that makes her feel like the prettiest girl in the whole club, even if she is just laying in bed at home (which she does often: day-dreaming or chatting on the phone with Sweef about herself, her incredible success, and her many soulmates). Professionally, Pom-Pom performs a hot Cabaret stand up routine in all the hippest comedy clubs in the city. While Cabaret may pay the bills, Pom-Pom considers her real job to be curating and lording over the city's poppin' night scene. She is always the first to know about any drama, any heartbreaks, any successes, any failures, or any totalllll embarrassments that happen within her expansive circle of up-and-coming superstars. When she isn't dreaming, performing, or gossiping (and usually WHILE she is dreaming, performing, and gossiping) Pom Pom is absolutely smitten with Love Games. Whenever she sees a hunky Toshi who impresses her with his hot bod, untapped talent, or unparalleled attention-- she is instantly obsessed. She falls head over heels in love weekly... sometimes daily... sometimes multiple times a night! This babe sees a glimmer of Romeo in every handsome stranger she locks eyes with, and she is a master at making him see his Juliet in her innocent, determined gaze. She uses the full force of her Wink and her Kissy face to woo her unsuspecting suitors, before killing them off quickly (but lovingly!!) with her legendary Heartbreaker attack. No one thinks it can happen to them until it does! So be careful with this girl! She is a great time and a powerful ally if you manage to dodge her initial advances. To truly tame her though, you will need to find a way to capture and hold her attention so raptly that all the other Romeo's fade away into nothingness...Can you be Pom Pom's true love? Her 5ever Romeo? The one bone she never bury's in her graveyard of broken hearts?

Plagon;136;2;1;1;Plagon has never been seen in the daylight, and rarely even at night. When she does go out, she is surrounded by a shroud of unsettling vibes and tends to stay on the periphery of society. If you do manage to spot her, you'll notice that she seems to float rather than walk-- is there even a Toshi under that cloak at all? Or is it just a ghost wrapped up in Toshi clothing? Plagon often asks herself the same question on her moonlit wanderings... Her mind generally flickers between enraged faxations on past wrongs-- done both to her personally and to the world at large-- and then to psychic explorations of the metaphysical realm using her special Tap. Sometimes the mind's of passersby run interference on her power and to her annoyance, she finds herself sucked into the mundane thoughts of strangers. Sometimes even plants will interfere with her psychic journeys, though she likes it when this happens and always finds herself unusually calm in plantasia. She is forever plotting her revenge on the evil and boring parts of the physical world, though she rarely finds the right moment to enact these devastating vengeances. Because of this and her chosen isolation, she is constantly on edge and can be easily pushed to violence if you startle her by encroaching on her solitude. Plagon's Revenge is earth-shattering and feared across all worlds. If you can gain her trust through up-front financial compensation, or through a genuine and infinite offer of friendship, she will help you avenge yourself against any wrong done to you or to that which you care about. She values friendship more than anything else, and fears/loathes betrayal just as much. If your intentions are pure or if your bag is secure, you should be able to get along with Plagon. If notâ€¦ watch out! You never know when her Revenge will strike, but when it does you will be completely ruined!;177;12;0;85;100;60;95;110;65;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '102251a9109c81d44b1dc5634fb56fb4', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '2704c40e1d8e7254d8a0dedbbb49f1e7', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '74ef0b2d1708cc144b849edc7267d1fd', 'type': 2}}]
Plageau;137;3;0;2;Plageau is recklessly attuned to the Unseen powers of the world-- the magic the most Toshi would never dare to play with and that most do not even know exists. Where others remain blissfully unaware or respectfully cautious, Plageau is eagerly fascinated and enthralled with the buzzing energy of the Dark. He gleefully dives into these currents, causing black outs from the unnatural energy surges and spraying disease into the air where his corporeal body dissipates into nothingness as he enters the churning chaos of the electric void. One of Plageau's favorite games is to hit other Toshi with his Light Out attack, which will momentarily make them lose all of their sensory capability. When he has his victims totally incapacited and unable to see/touch/feel/taste/or hear the world around them, Plageau will go totally sicko mode and use his rare Terrorize attack. This power allows him to channel the Darkness into his prey's mind, and make them perceive things around them which aren't actually there-- the scarier the better. He is a total #savage with it tbh. If you can get a Plageau on your side, you have a powerful ally, but it is almost impossible to make him stop playing with chaos for long enough to convince him to team up with you. Just remember, with Plageau, things are rarely what they seem.;290;12;0;90;130;70;100;110;85;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'ae8030f81cf3d4447bcf20738c69f96b', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '955b37a816682bf43956f9b2b746a0fe', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '5600eeb130408294a847db7f5377fa2e', 'type': 2}}]
Glumpy;138;2;0;0;Glumpy is a pretty big name in the punk community. She is the front woman of the most popular underground band in her city (Glumpy and the Glumpers), has a successful hyperpop project (1b!ll!0nglumps), and occasionally will tour her DJ set which has no name but a big reputation. Because she is so busy making music and in such high demand when she isn't, Glumpy is hard to score a conversation with. At the end of the day she is a sweet girl, but at some point she got swept up in her own tidal wave of talent and underground fame. A lot of people feel like they are close with her even though they have never met her because her music is so pervasive and relatable. As a result of the para-social bonding that so many seem to have with her, Glumpy has had to develop her Sucker Punch so she can quickly fend off groupies and get right back to working or vibing as usual. To gain Glumpy's respect you gotta come to her as a Real One, and not fall victim to her personable song writing and good looks. Don't fangirl, don't be too starry-eyed. Bring something to the table and keep the vibes good-- Glumpy will eventually notice that you are a chiller worthy of her time.;178;12;0;65;110;100;110;55;100;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '769797c7739bf3048b10ef0d969da560', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'bf5d7db8aa8e2e04eac2d39ff97d0151', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '74ef0b2d1708cc144b849edc7267d1fd', 'type': 2}}]
Dyode;139;2;0;0;Dyode is a total boyboss. He loves the rules and is here to keep things running smoothly. While his main goal in life is to be helpful to others, if the rules he functions by are bent or broken, this little guy can get all types of peeved. The rules are there for a reason!!! Although he hates a broken rule, his absolute favorite pleasure in life is to Berate the rule breaker like only he can. His power of Berate has become the cornerstone of his career and never gets old. While Dyode can be a bit exhausting, he has good intentions and can help more chaotic Toshi's maintain a semblance of much needed order. No deck is truly complete without a Dyode to keep things running smoothly and to make sure everyone stays in line. He also loves doing all the paperwork that most people dread. To get a Dyode on your side, you can either break a rule and impress him into loyalty with your grovelling apology OR you can try to catch him in a mistake. If you can do this second option, a Dyode will spend the remainder of eternity writhing in shame for his error and relentlessly try to make it up and prove to you that he is not a total mess like all the other Toshi.;179;4;0;85;70;130;130;70;55;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '64fd7f6b353d405489d3741261e06f1f', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '99bbbfcdc8dcbc44ca075e983a7f8548', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'f2c018b0347f62841bcefe80acded118', 'type': 2}}]
Plug;140;2;1;1;Plug is an essential worker for sure, and not stoked about it. They float purposefully around town, from job to job, glaring at all the frivolous Toshi who have never seen a hard day's work in their life. Don't these phonies know the value of labor? Have any of them ever really felt needed? Plug freaking doubts it! If you catch them on a bad day, act overly lazy around them, or say something that they feel devalues their work, they will summon all their energy stores and lash out at you with their Electrocute attack, feeling the full force of their power source is unpleasant at LEAST and can be deadly. Luckily Plug rarely shoots to kill, and even a little stun is rare because of the intimidating and unapproachable vibes they shoot off. Plug is a high functioning Toshi who respects those who understand the value of work and dependability. Though it can be confusing to figure out how to direct their energy sometimes, if you have their respect, they will diligently do any task you give them. They are a good guy deep down, and a loving addition to any family-- they just can't stand all the funny business!;180;4;0;60;100;100;100;90;90;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'd2bbc2fa501981447bfe7a7c4c46dd21', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '48e7072ace8583a4f9565062ec772360', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'e1b1cea650414b34a88107c1a27d508f', 'type': 2}}]
Tower;141;3;0;2;Tower is directing energy, running the grid, getting it all done with airtight leadership and endless energy. As an Executive Operator in whatever career she pursues, she doesn't have time for much activity or social life. Tower stays firmly planted and uses Shoo to keep people at arms length. You can't have success and have friends! She is bristling with energy that she carefully channels to all the places that need it most. When she needs to, she can pull all the energy she has delegated out back to her and create a powerful Energy Beam. This Beam has the power to destroy entire cities, but also to fuel enormous projects, propelling them into their fullest capabilities at turbo speed. Like any good boss, Tower takes care of the people who depend on her. To win her over, it is best to get in touch with her people to schedule a meeting as she is a very busy woman, though she is eager to hear what projects you want to fuel with her. She is a fair woman, but can sense a bad deal or a con from a mile away so make sure that you plan your business strategy out thoroughly and honestly before you bring it to her.;291;4;0;70;125;105;85;85;90;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'ee4f8103710cce74aac9a60147eeed7d', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '64fd7f6b353d405489d3741261e06f1f', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '5aba3bb0941d7344c8abcb419e294066', 'type': 2}}]
Ghoun;142;4;0;0;Ghoun is just that, a goon. But a complex goon. Has a steady unbreakable gaze that pierces the soul but in a cute way, which makes it hurt even more because you feel betrayed. Ghoun is sort of slow and floats low to the ground. Its Scare attack is especially brutal as it is said to make its opponents fall under the illusion of having their soul being split into twelve different (but equally horrific) dimensions. Although it is a psychologically painful process for its target, the memory of the Scare attack does not last long. This is not because Ghoun is weak, though. It helps Ghoun to have its opponents underestimate it. You will usually find Ghoun at night near caves and very obviously haunted houses and graveyards, so you're probably pretty stupid if you run into one. They tend to show up EVERYWHERE if you tend to leave people on read or are notorious for ghosting. You probably deserve it!!;303;10;0;80;105;65;155;115;130;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '7396d05f9e04b39418eb1949cee84a76', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '300473a10782b224bb4a96a257521dec', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'b0a85777318ef984d91a34e238980591', 'type': 2}}]
Aghast;143;4;0;0;Aghast is a master manipulator. It has a bit of a limp when it walks, probably due to its short legs. It looks pretty funny when it limps, and it doesn't help that it makes a slight grunting noise. But please, try not to laugh at it because it will unleash its strongest attack on you, Implode. This is not an accident, follow your gut with your first impression on Aghast. Aghast is intimidating, but it has adapted itself to have silly mannerisms to throw you off. A master manipulator, Aghast is a manifestation of spirits past from ancient times. They can be found lurking in high energy environments, usually preferring dry burial grounds over wet ones. This Toshimon is sought out for its gold band which is messed up but you can't deny that the dead from the past really worked that drip.;304;10;0;160;110;115;95;110;60;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '7396d05f9e04b39418eb1949cee84a76', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '755a493865240504699fc094f13bbc13', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '8e7c533deb1495245bc3940a86c693b6', 'type': 2}}]
Pyrus;144;4;0;0;Pyrus has big ole burning eyes and a turned down lil' mouth. Its Flam-nado attack burns its opponents to a criisssspppppy dry cracker that is dangerous to consume but weirdly tastes really good, although you really shouldn't be eating burnt Toshimons. They are quick and hot-headed but actually really soft to Toshimons that can withstand their heat. Pyrus's can be found around volcanoes, but they also like to frequent the neighborhood campfire because they can get lonely and they love lighter fluid. They are born inside the pits of a volcano and travel all the way up to the mouth of it, being spat out as little embers that eventually catch fire and become a Pyrus. If you want to lure a Pyrus, be sure to have a juicy peach in your pocket.;305;10;2;90;95;100;120;125;120;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '7396d05f9e04b39418eb1949cee84a76', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '86d33be10a4a2bd4abb14eaa2ddb002a', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': 'e028badd4e3f3bd4f8155ae2e0ccb104', 'type': 2}}]
ZK;145;4;0;0;Oh Zk... Everyone wants to be around a ZK. They are just so hypnotizing and cool, even their attack Soulsuck is hypnotizing, albeit painful and extremely debilitating. It is said that their opponents strangely want to experience ZK's Soulsuck because some say that it leaves with you a bit of its essence. They are slithery little Toshimons and look like they are swimming because of their ethereal and magnetic body movements. They are usually found around large bodies of water surrounded by dense forests, and show up in reflections of the water, meaning you are more likely to see them at night. You will know if you are near one because it will whisper tantalizing sweet-nothings that get carried through the cold nights' breeze which brush ever so softly by your ear.;306;10;0;160;90;85;125;90;100;[{'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '1830ef2d44c5c18498d46f080ed350ba', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '8e7c533deb1495245bc3940a86c693b6', 'type': 2}}, {'moveBase': {'fileID': 11400000, 'guid': '4d40773acb9e6d84d96699e35cdd8a85', 'type': 2}}]

Strangely enough though, it can actually hang at the beach, in the summertime, slurpin' a whiteclaw on the rocks. Watermelon flavor. Its Hail attack is massive, covering an immense amount of ground that freezes its opponents into popsicles. Again, it loves the summertime!! Snark does have a spooky side though and it will use its Haunt on you if you don't leave it and its son alone. No seriously, they are extremely protective beings, so try to stay away from their ice caves.

It's not even a fair fight really, and rightly so because it is a legendary Toshimon. It's attack moves like Heartbreak and Clone are so effective because of how warm and fuzzy they make its opponents feel. It's all an illusion though, shrouding you in a flurry of butterflies that is said to send you into an obsessive trance. Especially when it uses Clone to look like the crush that you fantasized an entire future with but you've never even actually met...

Monereau;148;5;0;0;Monereau has a goatee and looks like a wise deer. Its wings span a large distance with powerful gusts of wind. Stoic and dark, using Betrayal to do you dirty and draggg you to the pits of the dark crystal underworld. It's sort of ruthless and unrelenting, like it definitely has a dark past. But just respect its boundaries. If you keep your distance it's actually pretty chill. But seriously consent is everything and if you don't consent it will use Crystalizer on you which yes kills you but damn thats an amazing way to go, you basically get a free crystal sculpture do you know how expensive that is. She just guards the door of time, like, at all times. That's Monereau.

Claseek;149;5;0;0;Claseek is one of those elusive Toshimon. It's a legendary Toshimon and it's massive. You wouldn't know it's a living being right away. Claseek sounds beautiful, like a chorus of voices singing at a soft but high-pitched tone as it slowly glides through vegetation, rustling past large leaves that soak its body with crystal dew. It's breathtaking actually, and its polygonal appearance throws its opponents off. It just feels so 'other' and alien...normal Toshimon don't know what to make of Claseek. Extremely powerful, its attack VPN takes its opponent through an encrypted virtual tunnel that disguises them both, making their location invisible to everyone. No one knows what happens in this virtual tunnel, but you can definitely infer from the scars it leaves behind. Claseeks are amazing DJ's, spinning classic Chicago House music. They def know how to get the party started.

Satoshimon;150;6;0;0;Satoshimon is cute and is somewhat of a little trickster! Just because one is enlightened doesn't mean that they forget how to have fun. Satoshimons shimmer and sound like wind chimes with even the smallest movements they make. You can find them near most temples or sanctuaries playing around in a field of grass. Their souls are equivalent to 21 million prayers, accumulated from the masters who have led their many students through the path of enlightenment. Satoshimon's move Enlightenment raises their stats as they meditate to reach their full, unbridled potential. This state sheds the confines of their waking reality and allows them to unlock their subconscious minds. Truly amazing.
