# Toshimon State Channel Implementation

A monorepo for the Toshimon battle game implemented in state channels. This is split into two main components.

## On-Chain

 The on-chain components are contracts which live on-chain and provide the adjudicator for the state channels.

## Client_libary

The client library is a collection of C# class libs designed to help with the implementation of the peer-to-peer aspect of the protocol as well as the on-chain interactions.
