# Toshimon State Channels Battle System

WORK IN PROGRESS

This repo contains Solidity contracts and testing code to implement the Toshimon battle game using the ForceMove and Nitro frameworks for state channels.

The contracts mostly serve as examples along side the [specification](https://github.com/toshimon-io/toshimon-specification). Not for production use!

## Usage

To build and test the contracts:

(tested with Node v16.14.2)

Install the depedencies and test
```shell
yarn install
yarn test
```

## Building Contracts and ABIs

```shell
yarn hardhat compile
```
